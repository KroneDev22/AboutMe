#### **Info**

Hello, I'm Brendon, a currently studying game programmer based on the Gold Coast.

Iâ€™ve had the idea of being a game programmer since I was in year seven (2010). In the last few years I have gotten comfortable working in Unity with C#, and have recently been learning about Unreal Engine 5. 
Using Unity, I have made two games as a solo dev, and plan on making more. I make use of the KISS principle, because I find it makes things easier when working with a team. 
As a hobby, I picked up Blender, and have been using it now for two years. I would consider myself a bit of a jack of all trades. 

It may come off as generic, but I love games, both making and playing. My favourite genre to play would be co-op RPGs, though I also enjoy competitive PvP games. When it comes to making them, the feeling when a prototype becomes a game is second to none.

Away from the computer I don't have many interests these days, though I do enjoy snowboarding (only done it once) and indoor rock climbing (bouldering specifically). 
Growing up I enjoyed a lot of different sports such as Rugby league mostly, basketball, and tennis to name a few. My love for Rugby league faded a bit in 2012~ as other team members no longer played it for fun, and were negative even during the positive times.
