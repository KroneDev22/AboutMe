#### **Info**

Hello, I'm Brendon, a recently graduated game programmer based on the Gold Coast.

Iâ€™ve had the idea of being a game programmer since I was in year seven (2010). In the last few years I have gotten comfortable working in Unity with C#, Unreal Engine 5 with Blueprints, and learning Godot here and there. 
In trying to find the fun, I have worked on 4 projects spread over Unity, UE5, and Godot, with my current project being in UE5. I make use of the KISS principle, because I find it makes things easier when working with a team. 
As a hobby, I picked up Blender, and have been using it now for three+ years. I would consider myself a bit of a jack of all trades. 

It may come off as generic, but I love games, both making and playing. My favourite genre to play would be co-op RPGs, though I also enjoy competitive PvP games. When it comes to making them, the feeling when a prototype becomes a game is second to none.

Away from the computer I don't have many interests these days, though I do enjoy snowboarding (only done it once) and indoor rock climbing (bouldering specifically). 
Growing up I enjoyed a lot of different sports such as Rugby league mostly, basketball, and tennis to name a few.
